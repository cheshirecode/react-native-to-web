# react-native-to-web

This has a basic RN setup with
- [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/tree/master/packages/react-native-web)
- Split up bundler config to use in 2 Webpack setups (root and Storybook)

~~The plan is to add Rollup + Styleguidist and more~~

As the PoC work has been completed, this current repo will be archived in the near future, it's exported to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cheshireCode/react-native-to-web) and further development happens there.
